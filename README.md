# CertWare L-Related Domain Specific Languages

- An Xtext implementation of an editor for the CertWare L language.  
- An Xtext implementation of a parser for the L solver output.

This is a temporary project and repository until we have a
satisfactory working editor and satisfactory working viewer.  We will
move the specifications and plugins into the CertWare mainline
repository upon completion.
